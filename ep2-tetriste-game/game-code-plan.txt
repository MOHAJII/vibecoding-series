I'll help you create a plan for building this Tetriste puzzle game. Let's break it down into clear, manageable steps:

1. **Data Structure Design**
   - Create an Object/Class for game pieces with:
     - Shape property (circle, square, triangle)
     - Color property (red, green, blue)
   - Game bar representation using an array (max length 10)
   - Score tracking variable
   - Game state tracking (active/game over)

2. **Core Game Class Structure**
   ```mermaid
   classDiagram
      class TestristeGame {
          -gameBar[]
          -score
          -isGameOver
          +insertLeft(piece)
          +insertRight(piece)
          +checkMatches()
          +removeMatches()
          +getGameState()
      }
   ```

3. **Game Logic Implementation Steps**
   a. **Piece Creation**
      - Function to create valid game pieces
      - Validation of shape and color inputs
      - Random piece generator for testing

   b. **Insertion Logic**
      - Left insertion function
      - Right insertion function
      - Bar capacity check (max 10)
      - Game over condition check

   c. **Matching Logic**
      - Scan for 3+ adjacent pieces matching by color
      - Scan for 3+ adjacent pieces matching by shape
      - Combine both checks into one function
      - Store matching sequences for removal

   d. **Removal and Scoring**
      - Remove matched sequences
      - Update score based on matches
      - Collapse remaining pieces together
      - Update game state

   e. **State Management**
      - Track current game bar state
      - Maintain score
      - Monitor game over conditions
      - Provide state access methods

4. **Testing Strategy**
   - Test piece creation
   - Test insertions (left/right)
   - Test matching detection
   - Test removal logic
   - Test scoring system
   - Test game over conditions

5. **Code Organization**
   ```mermaid
   graph TD
      A[main.js] --> B[GamePiece Class]
      A --> C[TestristeGame Class]
      C --> D[Insertion Logic]
      C --> E[Matching Logic]
      C --> F[Scoring System]
      C --> G[State Management]
   ```

6. **Future Expansion Points**
   - UI integration hooks
   - Score multipliers
   - Special pieces
   - Level system
   - Animation states

This plan focuses on creating a solid foundation with:
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easy-to-understand logic flow
- Modular design for future expansion
- Well-defined interfaces for UI integration
- Maintainable and testable code structure

Would you like me to start implementing any specific part of this plan? We can begin with creating the basic data structures and core game logic.
